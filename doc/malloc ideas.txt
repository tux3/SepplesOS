Our llist of chunks thing doesn't work if we can't keep it contiguous...
We could have a "final" flag on the last chunk to indicate that it's not contiguous anymore
Or we could force it to be contigous anyway. Wrap already-mapped pages in a chunk
Now the problem is, how do we know that we can free it ?
Keep a flag and check every time ? That could work.

Keep a notOurs flag for chunks around already mapped pages. Make sure that the wrapping chunk is only around the already mapped pages.
When we try to allocate a new chunk, if we encounter a chunk with this flag set, check that the corresponding pages are still used
If they aren't, map the pages for ourselves and unset the flag. Merge with surrounding free chunks if possible.
If a free chunk at the end of the chunk list crosses a page boundary, resize that chunk so that we can unmap that page.
